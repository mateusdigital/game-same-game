## Description:



​The Same Game is a small matching making game created by mateus.digital.

This game was first created when I was in Minsk Belarus, during the pandemic in 2020 - I was feeling very homesick back then I tried to make something that remembered me my dear home, my mother and my dog.

For a long time it was forgotten in the shelve of projects, but in 2024 I decided to finish it and release!

I hope that you have fun!!

You can [play it online](https://mateus.digital/same-game)


As usual, you are **very welcomed** to **share** and **hack** it.

The project was created by using Pixi.js and Chroma.js, but everything needed
is included on the project itself - so should be no external dependencies.
